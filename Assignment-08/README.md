My experience learning HTML was slightly difficult to learn, I had to look up some youtube videos and look on our class website to get more information on how to do certain things. I like being able to watch videos and tutorials to learn how to do something, then the next time I attempt it, it is much easier.

I am anxious and excited to learn more about customizing websites. I am excited to learn how to add some color and more details to create a more appealing website.

My work cycle for this assignment was more detailed than the others. I watched the tutorial video twice through and used my book. I also had to continuously check the guidelines on moodle to make sure I was doing everything accurately. I also look back at previous assignments if I get stuck on something to help me out.
