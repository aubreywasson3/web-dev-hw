<h1>For What it's worth...</h1>
<h2>F. Scott Fitzgerald</h2>
<hr Size =10">

<p>“For what it’s worth: it’s never too late or, in my case, too early to be whoever you want to be.</p>
<p>There’s no time limit, stop whenever you want.</p>
<p>  You can change or stay the same, there are no rules to this thing.</p>
<p>  We can make the best or the worst of it. I hope you make the best of it.</p>
<p>  And I hope you see things that startle you. I hope you feel things you never felt before.</p>
<p>   I hope you meet people with a different point of view. I hope you live a life you’re proud of.</p>
<p>  If you find that you’re not, I hope you have the courage to start all over again.”</p>
