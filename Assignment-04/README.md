I went to NASA and the Mars Pathfinder Mission website that was created in the year 1996. https://web.archive.org/web/19961231235847/http://www.nasa.gov/
This website looks a lot different than current websites today. It is very plain and not a lot of colors or photos are displayed in the website. The font and text looks very simple like something you would type in a word document. The background is also a simple white color and the logo is not very readable. Today we have a lot more high quality websites that have a variety of fonts, images, and colors displayed which is very different from this website made in the year 1996. </p>

Summarize your experience with the GIT Module. What did you learn? What was difficult, easy, or still misunderstood?
I learned a lot with this GIT Module. I learned about embedding images and adding links to websites. I found that looking in my book to find out how to type some of these things was easier to see it and follow along. I am understanding everything a lot better now.
