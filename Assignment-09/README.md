The universal selector is used to style every element on a page. The universal selector is the star (*). The star is often used in computer science to mean “all". The element selector is used to select all elements of a certain type. This selector is applied by simply using an element name (the reserved keyword placed in the opening tag of an element). A Type Selector matches elements with the corresponding element node name, such as <p>, <span> , and <div> tags. Type selectors are generally used to make “broad stroke” changes to the style of a site. In the CSS, a class selector is a name preceded by a full stop (“.”) and an ID selector is a name preceded by a hash character (“#”). The difference between an ID and a class is that an ID can be used to identify one element, whereas a class can be used to identify more than one.


I chose colors that associated with the 80's era. I picked bright colors like a neon green, pink, yellow, and blue.
Pink: #FF377B, Green: #7DE522, yellow: #FBE608, Blue: #3AB1FC

I felt that this assignment was much more challenging than the others. I had to first think of a color scheme and time period that I wanted to make my website about. I hope my end result is correct because we had much more creative freedom with this assignment. I first found the images I wanted to use and did my research on the 80's. I chose to highlight music, fashion, and fun facts. I watched a lot of previous videos to help create my webpage and make sure I was linking everything correctly.
