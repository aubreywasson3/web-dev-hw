System fonts are those already installed on your local device and system, where as a web fonts are custom fonts hosted on a server. They do not have to be available on the user's device to appear, but require certain elements to get called up correctly. A web-safe font is different than both a system font and web font because it is available in the systems fonts. These include font families that both Windows and Mac should have, such as Arial, Georgia, and Times New Roman.

It is important to have a fallback font or stack because if for some reason the browser cannot load your first font, the browser will ask the client for the font. If the client doesnâ€™t have the font, then the browser will try the next listed font in the chain.

My work cycle for this assignment included going through the book first and then watching the videos to help guide me along. I thought about my favorite book and story when I was a child. Then, I tried to think about the theme of colors and image(s) I was going to want on my website. I tried many different fonts to pick the one I liked the best and also one that went well with the theme of the book.
