I have come across many forms on the web. I have noticed them mostly on popular websites when I am shopping. The purpose of them is to either fill out a survey, leave a review, or answer questions to help out their store. It helps companies make improvements and know what the customers like or want.

Text, selection, and a button input may be used on the bottom of a company or stores website. I think surveys and input are mostly located at the bottom of a website or on a separate tab.

I had difficulties with this assignment. I tried to add a submit button image on my website and could not get it to code/translate correctly. The image was not popping up on my website. Therefore, I just did the basic original submit button. I also was a little confused on exactly how I was supposed to set up the website. I looked in the book and watched videos to help get a better idea.
