My imaginary client was an owner of a coffee shop. They wanted neutral colors and for the website to represent what their coffee shop was about. They wanted to have images of their place on the website so viewers can get a feel for what to expect when coming to visit their location.

Compared to display: inline , the major difference is that display: inline-block allows to set a width and height on the element. Also, with display: inline-block , the top and bottom margins/paddings are respected, but with display: inline they are not.

I struggled a little with this assignment. I think that I watched the video and looked at the website for help, but still was confused one a few little things. I looked up YouTube videos and that helped a lot. I first thought of an idea for a website and wanted to make something with neutral tones and colors because all of my other websites have been very colorful. I found that it was fun to decide what my website was going to be about and the content for it.
