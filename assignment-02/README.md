I joined this class to learn more about web design and see if I really like it so that I can do this as a career and incorporate it into my future job skills. I am really interested in the graphic design part of websites and making them, so I thought it would be great to take this class and learn more about how websites are set up and created.

So far I have learned that there is so much more to a website than I had originally thought. I really appreciate the step by step videos. This is different than some of my media arts classes online. I think online classes are harder to learn when you don't have someone showing you how to do something step by step, so I really appreciate how this class is set up. The only way to learn is by being tought! :) I hope to learn a lot of skills that I didn't originally have in web design that will help me with my future career.
